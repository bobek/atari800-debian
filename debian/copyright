This is a Debian prepackaged version of the atari800 emulator.

This package was put together by Dale Scheetz <dwarf@polaris.net>, using
sources from:
	http://atari800.sourceforge.net/

While atari800 is licensed under the GPLv2 it needs access to proprietary ROMs
to be really useful. For this reason, it is placed in the contrib archive area.
